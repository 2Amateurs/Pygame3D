# Pygame3D
A module designed to work with Pygame to create retro-style 3D rendering functionality.
# Current Functionality
As of 6/3/22, this module can work with the pygame library to create and display cuboids with camera x, y, z, and rotation parameters.  My goal is to make this into a simple, retro style engine that will display pixelated cuboids onto a screen.  The demo physics project titled v0.19 also utilizes hitbox functionality from the module.
# Usage
Simple download this module and place it in the directory of whatever project you're working on.  You will also need to install the following:
1. pygame
2. numpy

In the future, this may turn into an actual library as I add more features.
